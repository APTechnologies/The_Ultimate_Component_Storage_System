# The_Ultimate_Component_Storage_System
The Ultimate Component Storage System is a unique solution for organizing and storing electronic components. The custom software allows for cataloging of components with a built-in search function to gain quick access to specific components. LEDs above each drawer are used to indicate the position and status of individual, or a group, of components.
